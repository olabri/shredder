## Lyrics

**Verse 1**
Neon nights and a paper crown
Six‑string dreams in a shutdown town
Every feed is a perfect smile
But my beat gets buried every mile

**Verse 2**
Late‑night grind and a worn‑out amp
Chasing sparks in a quiet camp
Algorithm lights the crowd
I just scream and I play it loud

**Pre‑Chorus**
I’m fighting the flood, I’m crossing the wire
Human heartbeat under static fire
If I burn, let it be my flame
Not a copy with a borrowed name

**Chorus**
We’re screaming in the neon rain
Human made, but they call it fake
I’m a spark in a cold machine
Still I bleed for the in‑between

**Verse 3**
Vinyl ghosts and a backstage door
Waiting lines that don’t wait no more
Every hit’s a perfect clone
But I’m building it bone by bone

**Pre‑Chorus**
I’m fighting the flood, I’m crossing the wire
Human heartbeat under static fire
If I burn, let it be my flame
Not a copy with a borrowed name

**Chorus**
We’re screaming in the neon rain
Human made, but they call it fake
I’m a spark in a cold machine
Still I bleed for the in‑between

**Guitar Solo (lead transforms into bass solo)**

**Bridge**
Let the drums keep the city awake
Let the low end start to shake
If the world forgets my name
I’ll light it up the same

**Final Chorus**
We’re screaming in the neon rain
Human made, but they call it fake
I’m a spark in a cold machine
Still I bleed for the in‑between

**Outro**
I’m still here, still alive
In the noise, I survive
